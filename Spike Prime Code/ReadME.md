## Spike Prime Code
In this folder you will find all of the code we created to drive our robot and complete SuperPowered Missions.
We also created a program to help us design our mission code.

### Measuring Code
The challenge we had when designing our code was to figure out how far our robot had to travel and how much it had to turn.
The next challenges was remembering and figuring out if the robot had to drive or turn in the opposite direction.
We found a Youtube video with a sample of code where the developer showed us how to display the distance the robot would travel when manually pushed.
We added some more code to that example that would show us how far and in what direction the robot would travel and turn.
When our team needs help figuring out what to tell the robot to do we switch to this code in our Spike Prime and write down the distance and degrees of turn the robot must make.
